"""
The "mayfly" challenge type — instances are ephemeral Vercel Sandboxes provisioned by the
external orchestrator, with a fresh per-team dynamic flag rather than one static string every
team submits the same answer to. See models.py for why MayflyInstance exists at all: vanilla
CTFd's Flags table is per-challenge, not per-team, so it can't express that.
